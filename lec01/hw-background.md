# Project: Background Knowledge

Link: https://www.notion.so/Project-Background-Knowledge-1f888315b6b480e88e2debbf76fa2235

Goal: Build a foundation of skills for the course

Study the following resources very carefully:

- Learn C by studying this book: ["The C programming language"](https://seriouscomputerist.atariverse.com/media/pdf/book/C%20Programming%20Language%20-%202nd%20Edition%20(OCR).pdf) by Brian Kernighan and Ritchie. It’s available online for free. Read and practice all eight chapters. It should about 20 hours maximum if you have strong programming skills already but have never used a low level language like C.
- Learn basic neural networks by studying this [post](https://victorzhou.com/blog/intro-to-neural-networks/): “Machine Learning for Beginners: An Introduction to Neural Networks”:
    - https://victorzhou.com/blog/intro-to-neural-networks/
- Learn tensors for neural networks in the C language by studying a repo called [“Creating a tiny tensor library in C”](https://github.com/apoorvnandan/tensor.h/).
- Learn concepts of neural networks: https://cs231n.github.io/neural-networks-1/#intro

Deliverables:

- Coding up the examples in the machine learning post using the C programming language instead of Python.
- Write a C program that re-implements the Python code in section 1 of the ML post called “Building Blocks: Neurons”. Write test cases based on the examples in the post.
- Write a C program that re-implements the Python code in section 2: of the ML post called “Combining Neurons into a Neural Network”.  Write test cases based on the examples in the post.
- Submission:
    - Private github repo. Add prof as collaborator. (Github handle: @suhabe)
    - README with instructions on how to run your program and your tests.
